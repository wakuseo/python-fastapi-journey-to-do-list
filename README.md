# python-fastapi-journey-ToDo-app
Fast API is my favourite Python API because of its modern features not found in other APIs. 

In this project, I will show the 7 advantages FASTAPI has over the alternatives, like an API built with Flask, and I'll do it while building out a fun little ToDo app.

::Here are the 7 Advantages::
1. - It's just plain Python: they've made it easy by just keeping the syntax just plain Python. If you know Python you can make sense of it.
2. - Built in Async: it async out the box
